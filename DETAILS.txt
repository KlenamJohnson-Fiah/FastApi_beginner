This was my first take with FastAPI.

Concepts pretty straight forward.

All downloads inside requirement.txt

Application was built using the FastAPI documentation.

App is just a simple vet app that holds details of pets and their owners.

API endpoint to be consumed:
	POST pet details
	GET pet details using pet ID
	POST owner details
	GET pet details using owner's name.


project structure:


	sql_app
	  |--crud.py
	  |--database.py
	  |--model.py
	  |--scheme.py
	  |--main.py
	  |--other files


crud.py:

Contains all my possible action function (CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete)

database.py:

Contains all database connections and initalization

model.py:
Contains the idea for how the database should be(the relation between tables and the columns each table should have)

scheme.py

This should have been schemas.py.

This holds or represents the structure data should be presented to or from the database.

main.py:
brings everything together.
Holds all our path functions


Key Technologies used:
SQLAlchemy for Object Relational Mapping(ORM)
Alembic for database Migration.
FastApi as the backend framework
